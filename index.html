        The following list is what I give to my patients to give to their relatives (especially children) as good habits to abide by in the hopes that they may reduce their risk of evolving to SLE. I do tell them the evidence is not overwhelming at all, but there are studies to suggest these may help, and they make sense theoretically. Links are provided for many of these (FEEL FREE TO COPY AND HANDOUT TO PATIENTS):

Abide by UV light protection
Floss and brush teeth at least once daily to help prevent periodontal disease
Have your vitamin D level monitored; take a vitamin D supplement if it is less than 40 ng/mL
Never smoke cigarettes
Avoid secondhand smoke
Avoid sulfa antibiotics (add to allergy list)
Do not eat alfalfa sprouts or mung bean sprouts
Consider healthy use of moderate alcohol drinking when old enough (talk to your physician first)
Eat a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids (flaxseed, cold-water fish, chia seed, walnuts, etc.). I prefer this over supplements.
Consider eating “resistant starches” regularly (legumes, peas, overnight oats, etc.)
Avoid occupations and hobbies with exposure to potential lupus triggers (such as silica)
Consider decreasing exposure to phthalates (lipstick, plastics, cosmetics)
Learn to cope with stress; do daily breathing exercises; practice mindfulness daily
Get at least 7 hours of sleep each night
Avoid the herbal supplement Echinacea
Avoid exposure to pesticides
Avoid using hair dyes (English et al., ACR 2019 and Smyk et al., PMID 26000137)</p>
